        <p>Yauatcha is a Chinese restaurant in Broadwick Street, Soho, London, England, specialising in dim sum.

            The restaurant was created in 2004 by Alan Yau, who previously created the Japanese Wagamama and Thai Busaba Eathai restaurant chains as well as the more expensive Hakkasan restaurant, also in London. Like Hakkasan, Yauatcha gained a Michelin star rating in 2005, which it lost in 2019.[1][2]
            
            In January 2008, Yau sold a majority interest in Yauatcha and Hakkasan to Tasameem, part of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority.[3]
            
            Yauatcha opened a branch in Mumbai in December 2011, and another branch in Bangalore in September 2013, Delhi in November 2013 Kolkata in September 2014, with Honolulu[4] and Houston[5] locations both opening later in 2017. The Honolulu and Houston locations have since closed.[6]</p>

            <p>Dum pukht (Persian: دُم‌ پخت), larhmeen, dampokhtak, or slow oven cooking is a cooking technique associated with the Mughal Empire in which meat and vegetables are cooked over a low flame, generally in dough-sealed containers.[1] Traditions assign its origin in pre-partition India to the reign of Nawab of Awadh Asaf-ud-Daulah (1748–97).[2] The technique is now commonly used in other cuisines such as South Asian, Central Asian, and West Asian.[1]

                <h1>JAMAVAR</h1>
                <img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/sbj8bzmjnl4/jamavar/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/jamavar-restaurant-mayfair-london.jpg"restaurant height="400">
                <p>Jamawar, or gown piece,[1] is a special type of shawl made in Kashmir, India.[2] "Jama" means robe and "war/var" is yard.[3] The best quality of Jamawar is built with Pashmina. The brocaded parts are woven in similar threads of silk or polyester. Most of the designs seen today are floral, with the kairy as the predominant motif. Historically handmade items, some shawls took a couple of decades to complete; consequently, original Jamawar shawls are highly valued. Modern, machine-made Jamawar prints, produced in cities such as Kashmir and other parts of Himachal Pradesh cost less to buy but handmade Jamawar are very expensive.[4]

                    Traders introduced this Chinese silk cloth to India, mainly from Samarkand and Bukhara and it gained immense popularity among the royalty and the aristocracy. Kings and nobles bought the woven fabric by the yard, wearing it as a gown or using it as a wrap or shawl. Jamawar weaving centres in India developed in the holy cities and the trade centres. The most well known Jamawar weaving centre is Kashmir and Punjab in India.[5][6]
                    
                    Due to its rich and fine raw materials, the rich and powerful merchants used Jamawar and noblemen of the time, who could not only afford it but could even commission the weavers to make the fabric for them, as in the case of the Mughals. Emperor Akbar was one of its greatest patrons. He brought many weavers from East Turkestan to Kashmir.[7][better source needed]
