        Ain't do no wrong
        I could clean up good for you
        Oh, I know right from wrong
        'Cause I wanna make it, so badly (mm, mm, mm)
        I'm a million dollar baby (mm, mm, mm)
        Don't at me, yeah, hell nah (yeah, yeah)

        No matter what happens, he cannot come between us again (mm, mm, mm)
        I know we're better than friends (better than friends)
        I took her to Queen's Gambit (yeah, yeah), showed around my friends (right now)
        Tried to pick some energy up, it don't matter
        I know you never moved on if you tried (oh, no)
        I don't believe it, baby, I know you lied (oh, no)
        All night long, what you mean, "I changed"?
        Haven't stayed the same
        Had me losin' my mind (ooh, ooh, ooh)
        I said, "The city is mine" (ooh, ooh, ooh)
        I ain't never rep a set, baby (mm, mm-mm)
        Ain't do no wrong
        I could clean up good for you (mm, mm-mm)
        Oh, I know right from wrong
        'Cause I wanna make it, so badly (mm, mm, mm)
        I'm a million dollar baby (mm, mm, mm)
        Don't at me
        I ain't never rep a set, baby (mm, mm-mm)
        I ain't do no wrong
        I could clean up good for you (mm, mm-mm)
        Oh, I know right from wrong
        'Cause I wanna make it, so badly (mm, mm, mm)
        I'm a million dollar baby (mm, mm, mm)
        Don't at me
        Hell-hell nah
        Yeah, hell-hell nah
        Hell-hell nah
        Do it-do it, baby, do what I could think
        Do it, baby, do what I should think
        Do it-do it, baby, do what I could think
        Hell-hell nah
        Yeah, hell-hell nah
        Hell-hell nah
