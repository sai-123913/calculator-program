            <p>Levi Ackerman (リヴァイ・アッカーマン, Livai Akkāman, alt. "Levi Ackermann") is a fictional character from Hajime Isayama's manga series Attack on Titan. Levi is a soldier working for the Survey Corps Special Operations Squad (調査兵団特別作戦班, Chōsa Heidan Tokubetsu Sakusen-han), also known as Squad Levi (リヴァイ班, Rivai-han), a squad of four elite soldiers with impressive combat records hand-picked by him. The squad takes the protagonist Eren Yeager under their wing as both his bodyguards and potential executors if he goes berserk. Though Levi is a supporting character, his backstory is explored when dealing with his former mentor Kenny during the main series as well as in the spin-off manga Attack on Titan: No Regrets.

                Levi was based on the Watchmen character Rorschach, among other influences. In the anime adaptation of the series, Levi is voiced by Hiroshi Kamiya in Japanese and Matthew Mercer in English. His portrayal in No Regrets did not display major differences in characterization despite acting as his backstory.
